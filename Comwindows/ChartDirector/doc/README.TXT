           *** IMPORTANT NOTES FOR VIEWING CHM FILES ***

- On Windows, downloaded CHM files, or CHM files extracted from 
downloaded zip files, must be unblocked before they can be viewed. To 
do this, from the File Explorer, right click on the CHM file, select 
Properties, click the "Unblock" button, and press "OK". 

- Due to security reasons, the CHM documentation should be on the 
local hard disk (not a network drive), otherwise Windows may consider 
it to be "untrusted" and refuse to open it. 

- On some Windows machines, the CHM viewer may not support path names 
with URL reserve characters (such as "C++"). To avoid uncertainties, 
it is suggested the directory path that contain the CHM file should 
consist of ASCII characters only.
